        I'm a 3rd year undergraduate software engineering student at the University of Alberta, a Software Developer Intern at
        SUBNET Solutions, and an incoming Software Engineer Intern at Dayforce, on the Developer Experience Team (Infrastructure/DevOps & Internal Software Tool Dev).
        
        I enjoy creating applications that tackle social problems (or are just cool) and I love being part of university clubs!:)
